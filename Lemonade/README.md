Lemonade APP
================================
Introduction
------------
The Lemonade app is a simple Compose app that allows the user to make digital lemonade by tapping through a series of steps: select a lemon from the tree, squeeze the lemon, drink the glass of lemonade, and start again.

The concepts covered in this app are:
 - Simple UI layout in Compose
 - Add clickable behavior to a composable
 - Use remember and mutableStateOf to keep track of relevant state in the app
